# Pie documentation

Full documentation of the `Pie` command interface line (CLI) in the **1.1.0** version. Go to [change log](https://github.com/jaedsonpys/pie/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) to see the changes for **all versions**.

## Creating a repository

To create a repository, use the `pie init` command along with the `--author` and `--author-email` flags, passing your **name and e-mail address**.

```
pie init --author 'Jaedson Silva' --author-email 'email@mail.com'
```

After that, your repository has been created.

## Checking files status

The `pie status` command will display untracked files, uncommitted files, and files that have been added **but not yet committed** (new):

```
pie status
```

## Adding Files

Adding a file means tracking, i.e. Pie will recognize this file and organize its commits. To add a file, use the `pie add` command and pass the files as argument:

```
pie add README.md LICENSE
```

## Commit files

Use the `pie commit` command passing as argument the files to commit. You also need to pass a message to the `-m` flag, specifying the changes you commit:

```
pie commit README.md -m 'adding README.md'
```

The same works for committing multiple files:

```
pie commit setup.py setup.cfg -m 'creating project setup'
```

## View the commits log

Use the `pie log` command to see **all commits** performed, from the first to the last. The log contains information such as author, date, commit hash and the message.

```
pie log
```

## View file difference

You can view the difference between files using the `pie diff` command. This command will display the difference between all alterdis files:

```
pie diff
```

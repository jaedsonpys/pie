A version control **written in Python** that is being *developed* to be simple and complete. A **totally improved** version of [Vestory](https://github.com/jaedsonpys/vestory).

You can **follow development** in the `dev` branch ([dev branch on GitHub](https://github.com/jaedsonpys/pie/tree/dev)), where development is taking place until the **first version** is ready.
